# RateThatDrink

[RateThatDrink](https://rate-that-drink.vercel.app/) is simple app that allows you to Vote which of the two random drinks selected is better.

## Technologies used

1. [**Next.Js:**](https://nextjs.org/) no needs for introductions :)
2. [**Tailwind:**](https://tailwindcss.com/) utility first CSS framework
3. [**Prisma:**](https://www.prisma.io/) ORM used for database (MySQL) operations
4. [**PlanetScale:**](https://planetscale.com/) provides MySQL database

## Getting started

Use our handy CLI command to spin up a RateThatDrink: `yarn` and `yarn dev`. For all functionalities you will need to provide SHADOWBASE_URL and DATABASE_URL (from planetscale) as variables. Put them in .env.local file and all should work fine ðŸš€

## Feature set

This project is something I made in my free time with technologies that I enjoy! [demo](https://rate-that-drink.vercel.app/).
